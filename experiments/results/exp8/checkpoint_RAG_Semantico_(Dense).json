The main features of AWS ECS include:\n\n* A logical grouping of tasks or services called clusters, which can be used to isolate applications and prevent them from using the same underlying infrastructure [Source: aws/ECS/AWS services integrated with Amazon ECS<a name=\"ecs-integrations\"></a> > Clusters<a name=\"welcome-clusters\"></a>].\n* Flexible scheduling capabilities for tasks and containers, with each task having its own isolation boundary and not sharing underlying resources with other tasks [Source: aws/ECS/Scheduling Amazon ECS tasks<a name=\"scheduling_tasks\"></a>].\n\nNote that the provided context does not mention any specific features of AWS ECS beyond these two points.",

      "answer": "To deploy a containerized application on AWS EC2, you can use Docker Desktop or install Docker on an Amazon EC2 instance.\n\n**Option 1: Using Docker Desktop**\n\nYou can use Docker Desktop, which includes Docker Engine, the Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, and other tools that are helpful when using Docker with Amazon ECS. For more information about how to install Docker Desktop on your preferred operating system, see [Docker Desktop overview](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).\n\n**Option 2: Installing Docker on an Amazon EC2 instance**\n\nYou can also install Docker on an Amazon EC2 instance by launching an instance with the Amazon Linux 2 AMI and installing Docker Engine and the Docker CLI. For more information, see [Installing Docker on Amazon Linux 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs/latest/userguide/create-container-image.html#install-docker).\n\n[Source: aws/ECS/Creating a container image for use on Amazon ECS > Prerequisites > Installing Docker on Amazon Linux 2]\n\nAdditionally, you can also use AWS App2Container (A2C) to modernize your .NET and Java applications into containerized applications. A2C analyzes and builds an inventory of all applications running in virtual machines, on premises or in the cloud, packages the application artifact and identified dependencies into container images, configures the network ports, generates the Amazon ECS task, and creates a CloudFormation template that you can deploy or modify if needed.\n\n[Source: aws/ECS/Amazon ECS developer tools overview > AWS App2Container]\n\nPlease note that these options are based on the provided context and might not be an exhaustive list of all possible ways to deploy a containerized application on AWS EC2.",

[Source: aws/ECS/Logging and Monitoring in Amazon Elastic Container Service]\n* For clusters with tasks or services using the EC2 launch type, you can use CloudWatch alarms to scale in and scale out the container instances based on CloudWatch metrics, such as cluster memory reservation.

If you could provide more context or clarify what you are trying to achieve, I would be happy to try and assist further.\n\nHowever, if you meant to ask about monitoring AWS resources using CloudWatch, here's an example:\n\n* You can use the `mon-put-instance-data.pl` script to collect system metrics on an Amazon EC2 instance and send them to Amazon CloudWatch.
