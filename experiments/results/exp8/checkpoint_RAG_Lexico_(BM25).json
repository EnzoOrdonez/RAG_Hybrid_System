      "answer": "AWS ECS stands for Amazon Elastic Container Service, which is a container orchestration service provided by AWS.\n\nAccording to the documentation, the main features of AWS ECS include:\n\n* Ability to opt in or out of specific features at the account-level or for a specific user or role [Source: aws/ECS/Account settings]\n* Support for identity-based policies, policy actions, policy condition keys, ABAC (tags in policies), temporary credentials, principal permissions, service roles, and service-linked roles [Source: aws/ECS/How Amazon Elastic Container Service works with IAM]\n\nAdditionally, AWS ECS provides a managed IAM policy called `AmazonECS_FullAccess` that grants administrative access to Amazon ECS resources and allows access to all of Amazon ECS features available in the AWS Management Console [Source: aws/ECS/AWS managed policies for Amazon Elastic Container Service].\n\nIt's worth noting that AWS ECS also supports running tasks on Linux instances, with options including Amazon Linux and Bottlerocket operating systems [Source: aws/ECS/Linux instances].",

      "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, I cannot find sufficient information to fully answer this question regarding deploying a containerized application directly on AWS EC2.\n\nHowever, there is information about using AWS App2Container (A2C) to containerize applications hosted on premises or on Amazon EC2 instances. [Source: aws/ECS/Amazon ECS developer tools overview > AWS App2Container]\n\nAccording to the documentation, A2C analyzes and builds an inventory of all applications running in virtual machines, on premises or in the cloud, packages the application artifact and identified dependencies into container images, configures the network ports, generates the Amazon ECS task, and creates a CloudFormation template. [Source: aws/ECS/Amazon ECS developer tools overview > AWS App2Container]\n\nTo deploy a containerized application using A2C on EC2, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Select the application you want to containerize.\n2. Package the application artifact and identified dependencies into container images.\n3. Configure the network ports.\n4. Generate the Amazon ECS task.\n5. Create a CloudFormation template.\n\nNote that this process is for modernizing applications hosted on premises or on EC2 instances, not directly deploying a containerized application on EC2.\n\nIf you are looking to deploy a containerized application using AWS services, it might be more relevant to use Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) with the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**.\n3. Select the namespace (e.g., EBS) and then select the metric you want to monitor.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use the AWS CLI or SDKs to monitor CloudWatch metrics programmatically.
